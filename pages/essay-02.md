# The End of a Segregated Force

The victories African Americans brought home were tremendous. At the start of the war the military mirrored society and followed a tradition of a segregated force. By the end they had proven themselves to President Truman with the Double V campaign  to have the armed forces desegregated which was the first shout of the Civil Rights Movement. They had proven themselves to their nation and to themselves.
	The Army had been segregated since the War of 1812. During the Revolutionary War the Continental Army had been a mixed force on rare occasions, without any de facto segregation. Black people participated on both sides of the Revolutionary Conflict. After the United States gained independence it codified segregation as the law of the land and it extended into the Army. The only American War without any African Americans participation was the Mexican-American War.  This was due to the controversy of the war expanding slavery  and the overt imperialism that came from the actions of the United States against another sovereign nation.  
	The American Civil War and World War One both saw African Americans used as combat troops but under niche conditions. In the US Civil War the use of Black Soldiers was done as a propaganda method and was the exception, as the captured “contraband” of escaped slaves often served the Army in the logistical role similar to what they did in World War Two. Black Soldiers got the chance to be combat troops when they were loaned to the French Command in World War One. The French used the African American Soldiers alongside their European Soldiers due to the amount of African Soldier who made up the Colonial Forces of France.

	With America’s entry into the Second World War, African American Leaders made sure to use the war as an opportunity. The Black Magazine the Pittsburg Courier declared
“We, as colored Americans are determined to protect our country, our form of government and the freedoms which we cherish for ourselves and the rest of the world, therefore we have adopted the Double ‘V’ war cry—victory over our enemies at home and victory over our enemies on the battlefields abroad. Thus in our fight for freedom we wage a two-pronged attack against our enslavers at home and those abroad who will enslave us. WE HAVE A STAKE IN THIS FIGHT…WE ARE AMERICANS, TOO” (Digital Archive n.d.)
This Double V Campaign would electrify the African American Community. They raised money, held charity events like black baseball games, worked in factories, and joined the armed forces in good faith without worrying about segregation.  After the war and their double victory, African Americans would begin to campaign against segregation.
	At the end of the war the Red Ball Express was legendary  and Black Soldiers who returned home started to use that legacy to turn up the political pressure. With the war over, African Americans had no worry over being called un-American for marching or striking while a global conflict raged. They formed the Committee Against Jim Crow in Military Service, which would later evolve into the League for Non-Violent Civil Disobedience. Using political pressure, the achievements of Black Soldiers in logistical roles, and the fear of a tight 1948 Presidential Election the Committee Against Jim Crow in Military Service successfully petitioned President Truman to desegregate the armed forces via executive order. An action Truman would later claim was one of the highlights  of his Presidential action.
	This success would materialize into the Civil Rights Movement. After WW2 African Americans would no longer just put in hard work with the hope their oppressors would recognize them.  They now had the confidence to go forward to march and petition for rights and equality. The veterans of the Red Ball Express founded societies to remember their service and sacrifice while also giving them a place to talk and organize for social justice.

# Change of Words: From War and Battles to Peacekeeping Operations

{% include feature/line-chart.html data="sotu-20th-century" topic="America at War" %}
### This graph represents how Presidents throughout the 20th century have talked on topics relating to warfare, battles, and military forces. Notice that it only peaks above average during the the First and Second World War under Presidents Wilson and FDR.

{% include feature/line-chart.html data="sotu-20th-century" topic=" America at Peacekeeping" %}
### This graph represents how Presidents throughout the 20th century have talked on topics relating to terrorism, intervention, and peacekeeping operations. Notice how it spikes with President LBJ, Nixon, Carter, and Reagan

Both of the graphs are talking about the same things, but in different ways. The graphs on America at War and America at Peacekeeping are talking about the same thing, military intervention. However; in domestic politics many Americans are not interested in or are outright opposed to American Intervention in foreign wars. As mentioned above, the movement to an all volunteer force helped Presidents use the military more without fear of domestic upheaval, but that did not change how Americans invisioned foreign policy.
